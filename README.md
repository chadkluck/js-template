# js-template
JavaScript development template with the ability to call an API built in

Download/upload to your sandbox/development environment. It is primed and ready to go with an example api request to api.chadkluck.net/games/ which will display at the bottom of the main index.html page.

There is an example of customizing variables on the main index.html page but all of the code is in js/main.js where you will find tools to help you debug through console log outputs as you code. The main block of code you will want to update and play with is in the execute() function.

If you would like to play with the Games API, it is in my repository at github.com/chadkluck/demo-api-games
